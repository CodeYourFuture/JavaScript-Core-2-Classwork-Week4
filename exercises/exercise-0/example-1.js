const firstName = "Moussab";

function printGreeting() {
  console.log(`Hello there, ${firstName}`);
}

printGreeting();


// In this case, the above function is a global scope and it has access to the global variable "firstName" which is outside of the function. 
// 1- The code defines const variable "firstNme" with the value of "Moussab" that is defined the global scope.
// 2- the code defines a function which logs a greeting message to the console.
// 3- The code defines a function named "printGreeting" which prints "Hello there, Moussab".
